# Primadoro

Primadoro is a Pomodoro-style timer that lets you keep a log of descriptions 
of what you've accomplished during your timer intervals. The user can create a
free account to have a database-backed record of their intervals, or can use the
site without an account and Primadoro will store logs to the user's 
local storage in the browser.
